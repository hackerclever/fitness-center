  <h3>DYNAMIC MOVEMENT TRAINING (DMT)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>DMT uses the body’s natural movement patterns through three-dimensional exercises.</li>
    <li>Involve your whole body by challenging your cardiovascular, muscular and neural systems at the same time.</li>
    <li>Movements can just use your body weight or be loaded for greater benefit.</li>
    <li>The more dynamically you move, the better you’ll feel and perform.</li>
    <li>Combine dynamic strength, fitness and functional training to exercise three times more effectively.</li>
    <li>Improve muscular control, use more energy for accelerated weight loss and build performance in everyday life and sport.</li>
    <li>Dynamic movement training is important to help you maintain a healthy body and healthy mind.</li>
    <li>Whatever you want from a workout, make DMT part of your training programme for quicker and more effective results.</li>
